Chef is on his way to become the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.

Given that Chef bought the stock at value 
�
X and sold it at value 
�
Y. Help him calculate whether he made a profit, loss, or was it a neutral deal.

input::                              output::
4                                   LOSS
4 2                                 NEUTRAL
8 8                                 PROFIT
3  4                                LOSS


solution::


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int x,y;
	    cin>>x>>y;
	    if(x>y){
	        cout<<"LOSS\n";
	    }
	    else if(x == y){
	        cout<<"NEUTRAL\n";
	    }
	    else{
	        cout<<"PROFIT\n";
	    }
	}
	return 0;
}
