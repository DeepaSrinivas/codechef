Vasya likes the number 
239
239. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit is 
2
2, 
3
3 or 
9
9.

Vasya wants to watch the numbers between 
�
L and 
�
R (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?

solution::

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int l,r;
	    cin>>l>>r;
	    int c=0;
	    int rem=0;
	    for(int i=l;i<=r;i++){
	        rem=i%10;
	        if(rem==2||rem==3||rem==9){
	            c++;
	        }
	    }
	    cout<<c<<"\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
