/***
Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "schtschurowskia", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.

We say that a word is hard to pronounce if it contains 
4
4 or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is easy to pronounce. For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.

You are given a string 
�
S consisting of 
�
N lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above — print YES if it is easy to pronounce and NO otherwise.

For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters 
{a,e,i,o,u} and the consonants are the other 
21 characters.

solution:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, len, max, count;
	string word;
	cin>>t;
	for (int i=0; i<t; i++){
	    cin>>len;
	    cin>>word;
	    max = 0;
	    count = 0;
	    for (int j=0; j<len; j++){
	        if (word[j] != 'a' && word[j] != 'e' && word[j] != 'i' && word[j] != 'o' & word[j] != 'u') {
	            count++;
	        }
	        else{
	            if (count>max) max=count;
	            count=0;
	        }
	    }
	    if (max>=4 or count>=4) cout<<"NO\n";
	    else cout<<"YES\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
